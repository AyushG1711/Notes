Macro vs micro task

Macrotask -> queue that holds all the setTimeout/event/networkcall/dbquery/so on handlers
Microtask(promiseJob) -> queue holding promise handlers(then/catch/finally)

1. First all micro tasks are executed 
2. 1 macro task is executed & then again all micro tasks are executed so that by taking in account changes of 1 user event. 


Heavy task then perform promise then 
In between heavy task do event
