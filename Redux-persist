stateReconciler:
First, the redux-store state is init with initial state.
Soon after, when rehydrating redux-store with the persisted data then how to merge present redux-store state with persisted state, is determined by the stateReconciler you pass to persistConfig object 

Values to stateReconciler property
1. autoMergeLevel1: It will simply take current redux-store state and replace the 1st level properties’ value with the corresponding values from persisted/incoming state 
 	Ex: currentState = {user:{email:””, dob:””}, name:””}
		incomingState = {user:{email:ayush}}
		mergedState = {user:{email:ayush}, name:””}

2. autoMergeLevel2: It will replace the 2nd level nested properties of currentState with incomingState
