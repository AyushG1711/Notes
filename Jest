Watch 
If it is enabled then jest keeps track of what files changed and will re run the tests belonging to that file only 

Test suites
1 test file = 1 test suite
Describe blocks do not constitute a test suite. Suppose App.test.js has 5 describe blocks yet we will have only 1 test suite for 1 App.test.js file, not 5 test suites 


Code coverage 
It is a metric that tells how much % of your code is tested. It specifies the no. of lines, functions, branches are tested. 

Ex:
<div>Hello {props.name?props.name:”Guest”}</div>

test(‘Test hello’,()=>{
	const s = screen.getByText(/Hello/)
	expect(s).toBeInDocument()
})

Now this test will check if Hello is present or not. We wanted to show props.name if it exists otherwise Guest. We did not check that part of the div which display the coverage lesser than 100% 

Snapshot 

Reference snapshot is compared with the runtime snapshot your test creates 
Ref snapshot is stored alongside the test 
For the first time there is no ref snapshot so the runtime snapshot created during test is considered valid & stored as a ref snapshot 

Now this snapshot can be-
1. React component, you validate your component against this ref snapshot of that component 
2. Class
