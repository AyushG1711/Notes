Crid basically represents an operation/task that is communicated to backend & we store this crid in an array in store. Suppose I have 3 crid for a thread for operation starred then it means for 3 times I have toggled starred, now let say delta comes for first star toggling which will show a flicker in UI then delta for second toggling comes which will show flickering & finally last delta comes & state reaches eventual state.
